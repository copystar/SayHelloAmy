#Say Hello, Amy

This is just another 'Hello World' twitterbot. [https://twitter.com/copystar_ebooks/status/245963914821648384] (It works.)

It is taken from [http://140dev.com/twitter-api-programming-tutorials/hello-twitter-oauth-php/] (Twitter API Tutorial: Hello Twitter OAuth with PHP) which is turn built on [http://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth] (the PHP OAuth library by Matt Harris).


##The backstory

The bot is named Amy because months ago on Twitter I _meant_ to write that I wanted to create 'an army of bots' but there was a typo that resulted in 'an amy of bots'. So this begins the AmyBot project.

I'm also using this repo as a way to practice my git branching because I have to separate all my sekret twitter codes out of this public repo.
